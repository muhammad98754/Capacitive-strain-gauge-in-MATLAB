Simulation of Capacitive strain gauge in MATLAB




Created a 3D model using MATLAB to visually demonstrate how changes in the distance between the plates of a capacitor can impact both the capacitor itself and the strain that is being measured.After calculating all the necessary parameters, I proceeded to simulate changes in capacitance in order to measure strain.
