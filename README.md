# Capacitive-strain-gauge-in-MATLAB
Simulation of Capacitive strain gauge in MATLAB  -my 1st semester project on MATLAB




Created a 3D model using MATLAB to visually demonstrate how changes in the distance between the plates of a capacitor can impact both the capacitor itself and the strain that is being measured.After calculating all the necessary parameters, I proceeded to simulate changes in capacitance in order to measure strain.

open the code on matlab and dont forget to run the code on live editor from where you can download a gif or any other animated file!
